          Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of
          Awesome's science faculty to study as

          following sections.

        <p>
          we are happy to accomodate you starting your study with us at any
          time, however it would suit us better if

          <li>First semester: 9 Sep 2016</li>
          <li>Second semester: 15 Jan 2017</li>

        </ul>

        </p>

        <p><strong>Subjects of study</strong></p>

        <p>
          At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open - minded
          research facility &mdash; as long as the subject fall
          <br />
          somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an
          intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just
          <br />
          the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that , of the
          idea you submitted we were most intrigued
          <br />
          by are as follows, in order of priority:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and the health benefits of
            Resveratol(C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>)
          </li>
          <li>
            Measuring the effect on performance of funk bass players at
            temperature exceeding 30&#8451;(86&#8457;), 
            <br />
            when the audience size
            exponentially increases (effect of 3&times;10<sup>3</sup> &gt;
            3&times;10<sup>4</sup>)
          </li>

          <li>HTML and CSS constructs for representing musical scores</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          so please can you provide more information on each of there subjects,
          including how long you'd expect
          <br />
          the research to take , required staff and other resources, and
          anything else you think we'd need to know.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Exotic dance moves</strong></p>
        <p>
          Yes, you are right! As pat of my post-doc work, I
          <span><em>did</em></span> study exotic tribal dances. 
          <br />
          To answer your
          questions, my favorite dances are as follows：
        </p>
        <dl>
          <dt>Polynesian dance</dt>
          <dd>
            A little known but very influential dance during dating back as far
            as 300BC, a whole village would dance around
            <br />
            in a circle like
            chichens, to encourage their livestocks or be "fruitful"
          </dd>
          <dt>Icelandic brownian shuffle</dt>
          <dd>
            Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm,
            they used to practice
          </dd>
          <dt>Arctic robot dance</dt>
